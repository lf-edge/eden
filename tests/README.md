# Eden testing

For testing Eden provides two essential services:

* A place where an abstract library that drives most of test functionality gets maintained and developed
* An overall harness for launching all the required components for test runs

You can read more about the general principles of Eden testing at:
https://wiki.lfedge.org/display/EVE/EVE+Integration+Testing

## Test building
Tests is a standard Go test (https://golang.org/pkg/testing) compiled by the `go test -c` command to obtain test binaries. Such “standalone” binaries and individual tests/subtests from them can be combined in test scripts with the ability to configure runtime parameters and a specific EDEN configuration environment. In test scenarios and configuration files may be used standard Go templates machinery with some EDEN-specific extensions.

Each test is placed in its own directory. This directory may contain a Makefile (with `build`, `setup`, `clean` and `test` targets), a test script and the configuration file `eden-config.yml` with the corresponding fields `eden.test-bin` and `eden.test-script`. If you have all of these components in the test directory, you will be able to compile the main `eden` programm and all the tests, including your test, using `make build`. In this case, the binary test file and the test script will be placed in the directory specified in the EDEN `eden.bin-dist` configuration parameter.

## Test running
The tool for running binary tests is `eden test` command:
```
./eden test -h
Run tests from test binary. Verbose testing works with any level of general verbosity above "info"

test <test_dir> [-s <scenario>] [-t <timewait>] [-v <level>]
test <test_dir> -l <regexp>
test <test_dir> -o
test <test_dir> -r <regexp> [-t <timewait>] [-v <level>]

Usage:
  eden test [test_dir] [flags]

Flags:
  -a, --args string       Arguments for test binary
  -h, --help              help for test
  -l, --list string       list tests matching the regular expression
  -o, --opts              Options description for test binary which may be used in test scenarious and '-a|--args' option
  -p, --prog string       program binary to run tests
  -r, --run string        run only those tests matching the regular expression
  -s, --scenario string   scenario for tests bunch running
  -t, --timeout string    panic if test exceded the timeout

Global Flags:
      --config-file string   path to config file (default "~/.eden/contexts/default.yml")
  -v, --verbosity string     Log level (debug, info, warn, error, fatal, panic (default "info")
```
If you have the `eden.test-scene` setting in your EDEN configuration, you can run it with this command:
```
./eden test
```
or
```
./eden test -v debug
```
for more verbose output.

More that -- you can run tests from only one test file as follows:
```
./eden test tests/integration/ -v debug
```
or with the selected test/subtest combination, possibly with some test-specific parameters:
```
./eden test tests/lim/ -v debug -a '-timewait 600 -number 3'
```
You can get a list of tests included in the test-binary:
```
$ ./eden test tests/lim/ -l '.*'
Log/Info/Metric Test
TestLog
TestInfo
TestMetrics
```
and descriptions of test-binary options that can be used for test scripts and '-a | --args' option parameters:
```
$ ./eden test tests/integration/ --opts
Usage of /home/user/work/EVE/github/itmo-eve/eden/dist/bin/eden.integration.test:
  -app-docker.yml string
    	docker yml file to build
  -app-vm.yml string
    	vm yml file to build
  -baseos.eve.download
    	EVE downloading flag (default true)
  -baseos.eve.location string
    	location of EVE base os directory (default "evebaseos")
  -baseos.eve.tag string
    	eve tag for base os
...
```
You will also see standard Go test run-time arguments that you can use to run a test script, as well as arguments for specific tests, for example, for stress testing:
```
...
  -test.count n
    	run tests and benchmarks n times (default 1)
...
  -test.parallel n
    	run at most n tests in parallel (default 4)
```

## Go template support

EDEN supports [Go Templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template) with the ability to use the Eden framework. You can use the `RenderTemplate` function from the EDEN SDK and the `eden utils template` command to render any file (for example, a configuration file or shell script) using tmplates. Test scenarious also support templates.

Functions related to EDEN that can be used in templates:
* `{{EdenConfig "<config_parameter>"}}` -- get value of Eden config parameter;
* `{{EdenPath "<dir_of_file>"}}` -- resolve path relative to the Eden root directory;
* `{{EdenConfigPath "<config_parameter>"}}` -- combination of EdenConfig and EdenPath;
* `{{EdenGetEnv "<env_var_name>"}}` -- read a value from an environment variable,  can be used for passing external parameters in escripts.

This allows you to use not only hardcoded parameters in test scenarios, eden-config.yml or any other file which may be handled by `eden utils template`, but to get them directly from the current configuration. Some examples about using of templates you can see at [Unit Tests](tests/units/).

## Test configuring

Specific arguments for testing binary files may be passed by two ways:

* placing them in the local eden-config.tmpl for this test, for ex.:
https://github.com/lf-edge/eden/blob/master/tests/reboot/eden-config.tmpl
then you must generate eden-config.yaml for this test:
```
utils template eden-config.tmpl>eden-config.yml
```
* use of test arguments in test scripts or a selected test from an executable binary test for ex.:
https://github.com/lf-edge/eden/blob/master/tests/integration/eden.integration.tests.txt

The second option is more flexible, because we can run the same test several times with different parameters in the same scenario.

The most commonly used `eden-config` parameters for setting up a test are:

* `eden.escript.test-scenario` -- name of file with a default test scenario. This file should be placed in the test's directory or in the `eden.root` directory.
* `eden.escript.test-bin`-- name of default test binary. Can be used with the `eden test -run` command to run the selected test from this binary. This file should be placed in the test's directory or in the `eden.root/eden.bin-dist` directory.

## Test sceanrios

Test sceanrios are plain text files with one line per command structure. The most commonly used commands are just test binaries with arguments. In sceanrios you can use inline comments in the Shell (#) and Go (//) styles. Comment blocks from Go templates {{/* */}} can also be used. Example of scenario: [workflow/eden.workflow.tests.txt](workflow/eden.workflow.tests.txt).

## Test scripting

Escript test binary `eden.escript.test` provides support for defining filesystem-based tests by creating scripts in a directory.
To basic implementation of internal Go testscripts added support of `eden` commands, test-binaries and templates.

Test scripts can be used as glue logic for test binaries “detectors” and “actors”. All components that are required for tests,
such as configuration files, test data, or external scripts, can be placed in a test script and processed by the Eden template engine.

You can read more about the test scripting for Eden testing at [escript/README.md](escript/README.md).
