# Eden

Eden is the simpliest way to setup & test [EVE](https://github.com/lf-edge/eve) and [Adam](https://github.com/lf-edge/adam).

Eden is inspired by Kubernetes workflows and CLI

All components of Eden -- the main executable file `eden` and test binaries can be used as stand-alone applications without the need to install and configure the development environment on your computer. Generally, you will only need a text editor to configure the system and create test scenarios and scripts using `eden` and pre-compiled test files. To create more complex tests, you can use standard Go testing machinery.

Eden contains series of integration tests implemented in Golang. Tests are structured as normal Golang tests by using `_test.go` nomenclature and be available for test runs using standard go test framework.

## Install Prerequisites

Install requirements from [eve](https://github.com/lf-edge/eve#install-dependencies)

Also, you need to install `telnet` and `squashfs-tools` (`squashfs` for Mac OS X).

You need to be able to run docker commands and able to access virtualization accelerators (KVM on Linux or machyve on Mac OS X)

## Quickstart
```
git clone https://github.com/lf-edge/eden.git
cd eden
make build
eden setup
eden start
eden status
eden test
```

To find out what is running and where
```
eden status
```

To create a new config named new1 and change the system to a new config 

```
EXPORT EDITOR=vim
eden config add new1
eden config edit new1
eden config set new1 
eden stop
eden clean
eden setup
eden start
```

To get the config & update eve image stored in dist/amd64/installer/rootfs.img  after eden has started

``` 
 eden controller -m adam:// edge-node get-config 
 eden controller -m adam:// edge-node eveimage-update dist/amd64/installer/rootfs.img
``` 

## Remote access to eve
Main way: 
```
eden eve ssh
```

You can also use telnet connection for Qemu console:
``` 
eden eve console
``` 

## Run applications on EVE

Notice: if you are on QEMU there is a limited number of exposed ports. Add some if you want to expose more.
```
hostfwd: 
         {{ .DefaultSSHPort }}: 22 
         5912: 5901 
         5911: 5900 
         8027: 8027 
         8028: 8028
``` 

Deploy nginx server from dockerhub. Expose port 80 of the container to port 8028 of eve. 
``` 
eden pod deploy -p 8028:80 docker://nginx
``` 

Deploy a VM from Openstack. Initialize root user with password - 'passw0rd'  Expose port 22 of the VM (ssh) to port 8027 of eve for ssh:
``` 
eden pod deploy -p 8027:22 http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/openstack/current/debian-10.4.3-20200610-openstack-amd64.qcow2 -v debug --metadata='#cloud-config\npassword: passw0rd\nchpasswd: { expire: False }\nssh_pwauth: True\n'
``` 

List running applications and their ip/ports
```
eden pod ps
```

## Tests

To run tests make sure you called `make build`.

The easy way to run tests is to call `eden test <test folder>`

For example -- run reboot test:

`eden test tests/reboot/`

Some tests may accept parameters - run Log/Metrics/Info test in debug mode with  timeout of 600 seconds  and requiring  3  messages of each type  

`eden test tests/lim/ -v debug -a '-timewait 600 -number 3'` 

You can find more detailed information about `eden test` in [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) and [tests/escript/README.md](tests/escript/README.md)

## Raspberry Pi 4 support

Eden is the only thing you need to work with Raspberry and deploy containers there: 

Step 1: Install EVE on Raspberry instead of any other OS.

Prepare Raspberry image
```
git clone https://github.com/lf-edge/eden.git
cd eden
eden config add default --devmodel RPi4
eden setup
eden start
```
Then you will have an .img that can be transfered to SD card. 
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/

For example for MacOS: 
```
diskutil list
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN
sudo dd bs=1m if=path_of_your_image.img of=/dev/rdiskN; sync
sudo diskutil eject /dev/rdiskN
```

Put in SD card into Raspberry and power it on

Step 2: Connect to  Raspberry and run some app.

```
eden eve onboard
eden pod deploy -p 8028:80 docker://nginx
```

After these lines you will have nginx available on public EVE IP at port 8028

Use 
```
eden status
eden pod ps
```
to get the status of the deployment

### Obtain information about EVE on SD card

To get information from SD card about previously flashed instance of EVE you should:

Step 0 (for MacOS): Install required packets after installing of [brew](https://brew.sh/):
```
brew cask install osxfuse
brew install ext4fuse squashfuse
```

Step 1: List partitions.

For MacOS `diskutil list`

For Linux `lsblk`

You should find your SD and 5 partitions on it.

Step 2: Mount partitions of SD card on your PC

For MacOS (`diskN` is SD card from step 1)
```
sudo umount /dev/diskN*
sudo squashfuse /dev/diskNs2 ~/tmp/rootfs -o allow_other
sudo ext4fuse /dev/diskNs9 ~/tmp/persist -o allow_other
```
For Linux (`sdN` is SD card from step 1)
```
mkdir -p ~/tmp/rootfs ~/tmp/persist
sudo umount /dev/sdN*
sudo mount /dev/sdN2 ~/tmp/rootfs
sudo mount /dev/sdN9 ~/tmp/persist
```
Step 3: Extract files and save them:
- syslog.txt contains logs of EVE: `sudo cp ~/tmp/persist/rsyslog/syslog.txt ~/syslog.txt`
- eve-release contains version of EVE: `sudo cp ~/tmp/rootfs/etc/eve-release ~/eve-release`

Step 4: Umount and eject SD
For MacOS
```
sudo umount /dev/diskN*
sudo diskutil eject /dev/diskN
```
For Linux
```
sudo umount /dev/sdN*
sudo eject /dev/sdN
```

## Help

You can get more information about `make` actions by running `make help`.

More information can be found at the
[wiki](https://wiki.lfedge.org/display/EVE/EDEN) or in the #eve-help channel in
[slack](slack.lfedge.org/).

## Utilites

Eden is controlled by a single command named (in a secret code) `eden`. It has multple sub-commands and options.
Run `eden help` to see sub-commands.

To build `eden`:
```
make bin
```

To build `eden` and tests inside eden 
It's better to call `eden config add` first, so the build command can build tests for the desired architecture

```
make build
```


You can build it for different computer architectures and operating systems by passing `OS` and `ARCH` options.
The default, however, is for the architecture and OS on which you are building it.

```
make build OS=linux
make build ARCH=arm64
```

The generated command is place in `./dist/bin/eden-<arch>-<os>`, for example `eden-darwin-amd64` or `eden-linux-arm64`.
To ease your life, a symlink is placed in the local directory named `eden` for your current architecture and OS.

The current sub-commands are:
   * `config` -- work with different configurations of environment; 
   * `status` -- get status of all components;
   * `setup` --  get all components that are specified in the config and ensure they are ready for startup;
   * `start` -- start all components
   * `stop` -- stop all components;
   * `test` -- run tests; 
   * `info` -- displays Info records, accepts regular expression as a filter;
   * `log` -- displays Log records, accepts regular expression as a filter;
   * `metric` -- displays Metric records, accepts regular expression as a filter ;
   * `eve` -- sub-commands for interact with EVE.
   * `controller` -- sub-commands to update EVE.
   * `pod` -- work with applications running on EVE (containers and VMs)

## Eden EVE commands

`eden eve onboard` - onboard EVE that is the current config
`eden eve reset` - put EVE to the initial state (reset to config) removing all changes made by commands or tests

## Eden utils commands

`eden utils certs` - generate certificates for Adam and EVE
`eden utils download eve` - download EVE live image from docker hub
`eden utils download eve-rootfs` - download EVE rootfs image from docker hub
`eden utils sd` - get information about EVE from provided SD card
