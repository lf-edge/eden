# Running in the Cloud

When running the components that make up eden, most are run as straight binaries or docker containers. One, the core EVE device,
runs as a VM via qemu, and it, in turn, may need to run further VMs. In order to power this, when starting EVE devices, eden starts them
with hardware virtualization enabled. This is manifest in the following commands being passed to qemu when started:

```
--enable-kvm --cpu host
```

There are two instances where this might be a problem:

* Running on an older CPU without hardware virtualization support
* If you already are running on a VM, for example on a cloud provider, which would be virtualization inside virtualization, or "nested virtualization".

Note that some cloud providers have started to support nested virtualization. For example, see [this article on GCP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/enable-nested-virtualization-vm-instances).

If you tried to do this, you might get an error, e.g.:

```
Could not access KVM kernel module: No such file or directory
```

## How to Check

To check if this is a problem, you can do one of 2 things:

* Look for the above error message
* Check for the correct kernel module on Linux

The kernel module normally is `kvm_intel` on Intel devices:

```sh
lsmod | grep kvm
```

You should see both the `kvm` and the `kvm_intel` module. If you do not, you do not have hardware acceleration support.

## Running Without

In order to enable eden to launch EVE in that environment, you need to disable hardware acceleration. You can do that in one of two ways:

* Run `eden start` with the argument to disable it:

```sh
eden start --eve-accel=false
```

* Set the context for your device

```sh
eden config set default --key eve.accel --value false
```
