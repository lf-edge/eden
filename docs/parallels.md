# Parallels Quick Start

In order to launch an EVE instance, Eden, containers-in-VMs, VMs on MacOS
you may be using Parallels
virtualization software.

We will need Parallels Desktop Pro Edition.

Advanced features available only in ***Pro version*** and supports MacOS
Big Sur.

Once you start a VM in Parallels Desktop Pro for Mac for the first time,
it will prompt you to create or sign in. If we don't have Parallels account,
select the option I am a new user and click Create Account,
then follow the instructions.

After log in you will need to stop VM and make the VM config changes.
